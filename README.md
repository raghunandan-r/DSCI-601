# bing-E-search

Bing-E is a search result optimization web app that takes into account human implicit feedback to rank search results. 
The app currently includes clicks on web pages as feedback to rank search results for a session. 

## Usage

To use the tool, just head to https://bing-e-search.glitch.me/ in your web browser. For the time being, we need you to manually input the 'Bing' API key in the developer console. 
When you enter a search query, the tool will retrieve search results and display them on the page. Clicking on search results, will be recorded as implicit feedback and used to improve future search rankings.

## Future Development

In the future, the tool aims to include additional context such as time spent on websites, cross-session activity, and more. The tool also aims 
to improve the algorithm used to rank search results based on implicit feedback.
